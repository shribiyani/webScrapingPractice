      " Title: Best Python book for a beginner \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "OK. I'm a true beginner; seriously. I'm 35 yo English teacher who can easily create a WordPress site, or a Moodle course. Other than that, I know nothing of programming. HTML and CSS is easy. But all I know is copy-pasting code from CSS generators. Sure something has stick about CSS and HTML, but nothing about programming. I was terrified to even try.Until I met Python.It was love at first sight the moment I saw its syntax. It was like reading English. I felt like New in the Matrix. So I started watching tutorials on YouTube, taking courses on Udemy, and Lynda.com, but none of them provided insightful information about the ins and outs of Python; you know, like 'the devil's in the details' kind of stuff. (Sure there are some programmers who create video tutorials on YouTube but they cover only small parts of Python programming in depth and many of them left me wanting more.That's until I decided to google 'Best Python books'.I found many videos that were talking about Python Crash Course, and Python the Hard Way being better than this book, but just the fact that this is a 1600 page book left me curious.I gave it a try, and oh boy was I right.This book doesn't let you go to the next page without explaining in details what a particular concept means. And if it doesn't clarify it right on the spot, it lets you know that it will be covered on another chapter (sometimes I skipped the chapter to see if it was right -it was).I'm only on page 98 and can tell you that I have learned more by reading this book than what I've learned by watching video tutorials.Don't get me wrong. Video tutorials are fun, and many people learn from them. For instance, I've learned how to create an authentication webapp using Django. No book required.If you are a true beginner, buy this book. Don't be afraid about being 'old' and not having studied Computer Science. This book teaches you a lot of concept in a fun, user-friendly way.I'm planning on buying the other books that follow this one. (I wish the author be writing a 6th edition of this book, since we're moving to Python 3.7 now. Then, I'll buy two Django books. And then I'll start digging into tutorials to create my portfolio; the Django way. \n",

      "This book is overwritten and exhausting to read. It's not an intro to programming, but rather a bloated intro to the language's objects and syntax. At least a third of the text is spent referring to later chapters, reminding me about earlier chapters, explaining differences between Python versions, and explaining why the current topic is beyond the scope of the book, but still being discussed anyway. It's verbosely written in an ironically un-Python-like way. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I know a 1600 page book seems almost crazy but, before you start looking elsewhere (as I did) for something shorter, let me try to explain why this 1600 page book may actually end up saving you a lot of time and making you a better Python programmer in the end.First of all, I've read many of the other well reviewed, up-to-date, Python books (yes, all of them were shorter), and being new to Python, I ended up spending most of my time searching online trying to fill in the gaps that the other authors failed to fill in. With this book you don't need to reference anything else because the author does a great job of answering every question.  You can tell he's dedicated his life to teaching Python and knows what problems his readers will run into.While this books is long, it doesn't feel long. It's not just page after page of code samples. Each concept comes with a few code samples and is followed up by very well-written, clear explanations so it's actually a fairly quick read (for a 1600 page book). Does he repeat himself as other reviewers have noted? Yes, but it feels like when he does it's purposeful.Even though you often hear that Python is easy to learn, it's an incredibly deep language that requires time and effort. I believe that by having read this book that I'm starting out far ahead of other new Python programmers, I appreciate the language even more and I'm very comfortable even with Python's advanced topics. \n",

      "Very dense reading. Covers all details, which is what I wanted. But this book is entirely inefficient. If I had $1 for each time something is touched upon and then told it will be explained later, I could pay for all of my books. After several chapters, you wouldn't still be able to make a simple program if you didn't already know the language. Once every 50 pages there will be some great detail that should be mentioned, which is why I bought it. But the rest is the book apologizing for being too dense, but actually explaining to you why it is dense, because of prior editions' feedback based on non-programmers not understanding the difference between the command line and a text file. It's a great book, but easily could be 160 pages instead of 1,600. It feels like 16,000. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "This is a great, thorough, quality book on Python, targeted at individuals who have some experience writing programs, but who want to learn Python to write production-grade Python programs.All the people griping about how long this book is are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes the book is long, but to effectively use a programming language, there is a lot to learn.  And this book does a great job of metering out that information.  All the people griping about how there's too many \"forward references\" to other topics, are obviously not the target audience of this book.  Yes there are forward references, because there MUST be.  You can't learn every topic about a language in a linear way-- it's simply not possible.  If you are the target audience of this book, then you already understand that.If you've never programmed before, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a quick get-acquainted book about Python, this is the WRONG book.  If you want a reference manual for Python, this the WRONG book.  This book does NOT claim to be any of those things.  This book is a tutorial for people who have written programs before, who want to become an expert in Python.  If that's you, then you understand that the book is necessarily long.The Python language is a somewhat \"larger\" language than \"C\" or old-school Java.  So there is a lot to cover:  \"lists\" are BUILT IN to the language, \"sequences\" are BUILT IN to the language, \"dictionaries\" are BUILT IN to the language, \"tuples\" are BUILT IN to the language, \"sets\" are BUILT IN to the language.  This is in contrast to the Java language or \"C\" language.  This book explains all of those BUILT INS and \"why\" they are built in.  If you aren't interested in any of that, then this is the WRONG book for you.This book also goes into detail about why the language is designed the way it is.  And it does this not only in regard to the high-level design of the language, but it does this for every nuance and detail of the language.  This is great information if your goal is to follow best practices when actually using the language for real world problems.  If you just want to write little toy programs and you don't care about best practices, then this is the WRONG book for you.The entirety of the Python ecosystem is MASSIVE, and this book goes into detail about a lot of that ecosystem.  (Although even a book of this size does not cover ALL of that ecosystem).  This includes things like:  embedding Python in a larger \"C\" application, calling \"C\" functions from Python, properties, metaclasses, decorators, Unicode, exceptions, object-oriented classes, etc., etc., etc.You think it's possible to learn all that detail, learn all the best practices of managing all those language features, and do it in a 100 page book?  Well, if you do, then you are not the target audience of this book.  People who want to learn to use Python to do production-grade programming realize that understanding all this detail takes a lot of pages, it takes patience, and it takes forward references. \n",

      "The Definitive Python Bible. However, as a retired software engineer I can honestly say that this book is NOT for novices. It's really four books in one. Its also 1500+ pages long !  Its a basic-tutorial book, its an \"under-the-hood\" book, its an Object Oriented Programming Book and an\"advanced concepts\" book. All in one. My biggest gripe is that you need to read about the first 300+ pages  in order to have enough information to be able to write your first \"real\" program. This is primarily due to the fact that many introductory chapters also contain some advanced topics and show the differences between Python 2.x and 3.x. \n",

So time is of the essence and we don't usually feel sympathy for people that find pleasure in delaying our goals. The author of this book, surely because of editorial constraints or sheer sadistic pleasure over ruining your day and stealing your free time, will take you through countless sections like Unix Env and Icon Click Limitations before starting to show any respect for your thirst of moving forward. You could be misguided to think that you can just skip through the first hundred pages of gibberish and jump to where the actual programming begins, but the author has been careful enough to hide 2 or 3 critical paragraphs on the first hundred pages -good luck at finding them. This book is simply mediocre, an editorial assignment for a non imaginative writer.

      " Review: \n",
      "At 65 I am \"In-Progress\" in Learning (attempting) Python. There is so much information out there on Learning and \"Using\" Python that it is very easy to become Overloaded and almost Entangled with Unexpected Results. The \"Learning Python\" book by Mark Lutz is Incredibly easy to read. Almost like a novel in some respects, where you find yourself reading one more page, one more section, one more chapter. Detail flows, and is presented in a meaningful way that you do not become exasperated with the volume. Mark lays a Path from the Start that begins with what Python is and Is Not. Then how to install, and entry to how to use. From there the Journey Begins. Learning, Experiencing, Practicing, and Acquiring the knowledge in useful bites, maybe bytes....Mark has such a Fantastic Grasp on the Python Language that he uses his skill to Be Your Guide on Your Journey to Learning and Understanding How to Use Python. Whether in a Large Program, as a student, as a hobbyist, or as an integral component of your office work. He leads you on a level, paved pathway that leaves you with a smile.  His approach is so unique, that many who suggest his work do so in the matter that it is \"The Best\". I have to agree. I am an engineer and use C++ at an Intermediate Level. But found Python to be Overall Cumbersome and with many holes and obstacles to implementation.Following from Start to Finish, my Linear Way, and probably as most will suggest more than a touch anal, none the less his Learning Python has lead me to Where I am Now Able to Construct Applications that work. Here at home, and out in the field. Mark has such a fantastic way of presenting data, descriptions and how to avoid syntax errors, that you will come to the same conclusion of the all the others; That Learning Python by Mark Lutz is the Pathway Forward.Having a Copy of the Book on my desk while going through Tutorials from Udemy and a few other On-Line Learning Sites has increased my ability to obtain and use constructively what I learn, and where to look when I am unsure. I am sure some would think of his works as a Bible, I would interject the caveat that \"Yes, but it is so Well Written and Easy to Understand\". Wars will not break out. Will maybe. Python vs C vs Ruby vs Java vs (The Next New Language)Simply Said: For a $50.00 Bill you will have a Reference that you will always Appreciate. Sincerely Robert M Tonkavich.

For those coming from other programming languages, Python has its own philosophy for doing things and this book does a nice job of communicating those core ideas (the \"Pythonic\" way of programming).The author puts a lot of thought into the sequencing of material, revisiting concepts several times throughout to convey them at increasing levels of depth (list comprehensions are one example).

Many of the Python books are out of date.That being said, this book needs to be TWO introductory books: one for beginning developers and one for experienced developers; it vacillates between the two.  For experienced programmers new to Python you really have to scan the whole book page by page to glean the in's and out's of the language.  It's frustrating and time consuming.  There are leaps forward and back and lots of repetition which is probably good for some beginners but not for the experienced developers.  This book is useless as a reference, especially in electronic format, because of it's bulk and lengthy digressions.  I would love to see an \"experienced developer\" version laid out like the C# in a Nutshell book.For beginning developers this book could be daunting in sections.  Some parts lead you through things slowly and methodically and other parts are jumped over with reference later in the book.I would recommend this book because there's not many intro's that are current, concise and complete.

And if you are not a Noob, then wading through all of the explanations of why Python-is-the-way-it-is is a bit tedious.  For example, having 20+ years experience programming in C,C++,C#, and Java, the majority (but not entirety) of the first 3 chapters were a waste.I really wish this book were split into two separate books.  The first book could be an intro to Python for new programmers, and the second book, a deep dive into all the detailed parts for experienced programmers.  That way I could skip over all of the new-programmer nonsense.Still, I'm planning on reading the whole thing as it is.  And I believe it will get me where I need to go.

      " Review: \n",
      "A lot of folks seem incredulous that a book on Python is long. This is because they believe Python is a lightweight scripting language. It is, but it's also way more than that. Python has eaten so many good ideas from other, sometimes fairly arcane programming languages over the years (Haskell, Icon, LISP, etc.) that the language itself has become bloated in terms of the programming approaches it supports and its vast range of built-ins. Lutz guides you through all of it, from the basics of the PVM through functional programming and OOP. He points out shortcuts that run at C speed rather than Python speed, and explains how Python's data types and built-in functions work under the covers in terms of other other language constructs like generators. Do you need to know this stuff? Yes, if you're going to program Python professionally. And also the book is an excellent crash course in imperative/procedural programming, functional programming, and OOP. The book is long because the core Python language is big - bigger than dedicated scripting languages like Lua. If your goal is to learn basic Python syntax and move onto exploring libraries, then yeah don't read this. But if you really want to learn how the language works, this is probably easier than reading reference manuals. If you think a language shouldn't be as big as Python is, then time for purely functional programming, and you'll quickly find that reading category theory isn't exactly a walk in the park either, even if most pure mathematics tomes are considerably shorter than 1,500 pages. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "This book is compendious. It is useful for those, like me, who have programmed at least a little for years.But I doubt that it's a good first book on Python for anyone. The compendiousness is the problem. A first book should help you to get started quickly while providing with some knowledge—perhaps not much—of underlying concepts. (O'Reilly's Learning Perl is a masterpiece in this genre. Or at least the older editions were; I don't know what the newer editions are like.) This book, by contrast, does not get you started quickly. It is nearly 1600 pages long.You may think that you can skip most of the book—but about 800 pages are devoted to really essential topics. The author is simply providing too much detail for an introductory book. For example, his chapter on strings is 50 pages long, and 20 of those pages are devoted to various ways to formatting strings: how to left-align them, how to show two digits after the decimal place instead of three, etc.The author's style is not bad on the whole -- neither too terse nor too discursive -- and I suspect that criticisms of it come from rote beginners who simply need a different kind of book. But if you are an absolute beginner, it seems unlikely that this is a good book for you.---The book, published in 2013, is now quite dated. It switches back and forth between describing Python 2.x and Python 3.x, and it has no content on the developments that Python has seen in the last seven years, some of which are quite useful. A future edition would do better to eliminate all of the material that is specific to 2.x. (Note that Python 3.0 was released in 2008.)In 2013, this may have been the right book for some. But in 2020, I don't think that it's the best choice for anyone -- even though its comprehensiveness makes it useful for those who have some prior programming experience. \n",

      "I am a scientist and use computational tools as part of my research. As part of that, I've had some programming experience in C, C++, python, Perl, and others. However, I did not have much training in programming other than 'on the job' learning. As python was becoming a larger portion of my daily work, I wanted to really learn how to use it to better understand the programs I was running and modifying.I am currently on page 669, the start of Chapter 22 of 41 and Part V of VIII. I am reading through every page and doing every example and quiz problem. This is not a quick process, as this book is very dense and detailed. However, I've learned a lot.Each section builds up on the previous. Some tools are introduced before they're formally covered, though I don't know how that could be avoided. However, this is acknowledged in the text and things are explained sufficiently. The author also says when the topic will be covered in detail, if you want to jump ahead. For example, Chapter 5 covers Numerical Types. Booleans are introduced to show how they work, the author points out that Chapter 9 will cover 'truth' in more detail, and Chapter 12 covers Boolean operations.If you need a quick jumpstart to use Python, this probably isn't the book for you. If you want to really understand how Python works, and are willing to take the time to go through this, I don't think there is a better book. I am programming in python to reinforce what I'm learning from the book as I go, which I find helpful. I frequently flip back to previous sections to reference topics previously covered.Bottom line I would recommend this to anyone who plans to do much work in Python. \n",

As a computer hobbyist, who was looking for something to take the place of the old BASIC I used to use to write my own little one-off programs, I am blown away by Python, and this book does it justice.AND -  The Kindle version is well hyper-texted, making it very easy to use.  Thank you, Mr. Lutz, and thank you, Amazon! \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "There is alot of detail in this book. I have read other \"learning python\" books first, like  Think Python and the Python Scripting for Computational Science. I noticed that as I read this book it would have been impossible for me to read if I wasn't already familiar with the language thanks to the other, more accessible books. Some pages in Learning Python were very challenging to get through, but I reread them until they made sense and was glad I did.I have learned alot of details about Python that I did not know before and hadn't seen in any other book. I recommend it if you already write Python and want to better yourself. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I bought this book because of the overwhelming number of five-star reviews, however, I should have listen to the reviewers giving this book negative ones. As those reviewers have stated, learning Python from this book is like learning English from a dictionary.  I think that the author is very verbose and wastes the reader's time.  For example, the preface is 20 pages long, a useless Q&A session that is 23 pages, and a basic getting started guide (consisting of installing Python and getting around) consisting of 60 more pages.  You are not even introduced to the if statement until page 330!  If all you want to do is learn Python quickly I would recommend Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes.I have over 20 years of experience developing in other languages.  You do not need to know the whole language specification to begin to program in a language.  It is best to learn the basics and then learn the more advance stuff as you go. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I'm going to nit-pick a bit, so if you are experienced in other programming languages, please take that into account. First, Lutz's book is probably the most thorough of any of the \"Learning ...\" books for programming I've read. He covers virtually everything about Python's data structures, syntax, and other important matters. But therein lies a problem ... he is sometimes TOO thorough. As an example, he mentions that many programmers might go a significant portion of their careers and NEVER really have to understand how to handle or program Unicode. Then he spends several pages on the subject which made my eyes glaze over. In a \"Learning ...\" book, that's too much. Treatments of data structures and statements start out clear and concise but evolve (or devolve, depending on your frame of reference) into complex applications of those structures. Not that his level of treatment is incomprehensible or incorrect ... it's just a chore to try to learn a programming language along with trying to understand some of the extremely complex (and very clever!) ways he shows how to use various aspects of the language. Of course, that's probably why the book is over 1500 pages long. Don't get me wrong ... Lutz has done a masterful job of thoroughly covering Python, and it's an impressive work. But it would NOT be my recommendation for a 'first book' on Python for new programmers. But after you've got the hang of lists, tuples, strings and such, I WOULD recommend that you get Lutz's book ... it's got a ton of stuff in it that you will eventually find useful. Lutz's \"Learning Python\" could arguably be called the \"Bible of Python Learning\", but like the real Bible, when \"so and so begat so and so ...\", you might do better by reading a certain chapter to a point, then moving on when it gets kind of bogged down. You can always go back to find out the minute stuff if you find you need it. Ultimately, it definitely belongs in your Python library! \n",

      "This is exactly how books on software language's should be written. Yes, it's big. But it should be. Python is a Very-High level language with powerful data-structures built-in that must be understood. Otherwise, you will simply end up coding in Python the same way you code in C++. Don't fall into that trap just because you can't get the hang of a list comprehensions iterable mutating aggregates using filters with regular expressions. And doing it all on one line of code. I am learning a lot of necessary information from this book. It's a keeper. \n",

However, if you already know the basic syntax from a general course like Code Academy, then this book will take you to the next level. Do you know how to write a for loop? Would you also like to know how to rewrite that same loop recursively? This book will teach you how and so many more of the finer details that make Python a flexible language. It is no easy feat to read it in its entirety, but you will gain a considerable amount of knowledge and experience if you put the concepts to practice. So if you are tired of writing lame grade keepers, shopping carts, and battleship games and are asking yourself how to get to that next level, then this book is for you! \n",

      "It wouldn't be fair to mark it lower, but the cover and binding is pathetic! The publisher should be embarrassed: the spine splits when you open the book and lay it flat on a table. It was disappointing but at 1,540 pages you would think they'd make more of an effort. If you remove the binding problem this book is a Solid 4 stars! If it were easier to use as a reference, it would be 5 stars.If you're serious about learning Python there isn't a more complete book. However, it's not a book for beginners and may only fit certain intermediary developers if they have a formal degree in computer science. It's clearly a book written for proficient Python developers who want to move to the expert level and optimize all that they do in Python.The downside of how the author has organized the chapters is that the book doesn't lend itself as a quick reference. You really need to carefully read from start to finish, and you should have a solid understanding of Python programming (6 to 18 months). Upsides of the book are in Part V (Modules & Packages) and Part VI (Classes and OOP); they are excellent! They are thorough, instructive, and critical to great Python coding! \n",

      "BACKGROUND:Although I felt quite comfortable using Python; I had purchased this book in hopes of getting a more thorough walkthrough of the language itself.I'm very pleased to say that I got a lot more than I asked for.WHAT IT'S GOT:This book is extremely comprehensive, and reading it from end-to-end is probably the best head-start anyone could get when it comes to learning Python.The contents goes very in-depth on everything from very specific string formatting codes to the more advanced concepts such as contexts and metaclasses. Everything is presented so smoothly though, that the read feels very light despite the enormous volume of subject matter.WHAT IT LACKS:The only mention I would have is that the book does NOT contain any theory regarding architecture and design of systems, and NO references to anything beyond the language and frequently-used standard library modules. The book is more about the language itself than what or how you can/should do with it.CONCLUSIONS:I wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone wanting to learn the ins-and-outs of the Python language, with the mention that the content is plenty so a full readthrough would take a month or two depending on how much spare time you have.It's also really useful for re-reading chapters you might feel you have forgotten if you want a gentler read that what the Python manuals have to offer. \n",

      "In my experience there are two kinds of computer programmers, the academic( or what I sometimes call the cognitive learner) and the code jockey. In the context of this book, the academic wants a resource that teaches programming with a top down approach, where the author gives the fundamental principles first, and then illustrates them with examples. The code jockey wants a resource that teaches programming with a bottom up approach, showing lots of details and code examples without any principles needed. Contrary to what Mark Lutz says, this book uses a top down approach, where a topic is introduced with a fundamental principal shown, and then fills in all the small details( plenty of them, believe me!). It gives the basic principles, and then illustrates them. It is VERY complete and up to date, and from what I have surveyed to this point in terms of Python references, it is the ultimate paper reference book on the language.If you need a step-by-step tutorial with verbose examples and code on a specific application in Python, like data mining or web pages, buy a book specific to your application.

Even if you give up learning Python you can use it as a weapon because it weighs so much. :) The only thing it can't do is givr you the aptitude for programming. I highly recommend this book for anyone that wants to learn Python. \n",

      "Instead, get a good python reference book that covers syntax and core libraries and a python starter book.  Supplement with online documentation.This book is not designed as a reference and not useful as one, but it does cover all syntax in Python.  However, a smaller \"learn python\" version is probably more helpful supplemented with online documentation of python.For learning python, get a much smaller version to get jump started, and explore the online documentation.Also, for its size, it should go over a lot of the core library of python, which the author chose not to cover.  So after 1400 pages or so all that is covered is language syntax.  I am not a fast reader, and I was able to get through 3/4 of the book in a few days due to its repetitiveness. \n",

      " Title: A solid introduction to a fun language \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "The most amazing thing about this 1500-page book is that it's incomplete without its sequel, the equally humongous \"Programming Python.\" This book gives you a detailed tour of the basics of the language, its syntax and semantics and just a touch of actual useful programming. The real work, or so I gather, is in the sequel.However, this is a review of this book, not the sequel. That will come in a few months (which right there tells you I reasonably liked this book).The second most amazing thing about this book, then, is how clear it is.Python is a language both simple and complex: you can learn to write simple scripts in a day or so, but there is so much more to it. It is good for structured programming, declarative programming, and object-oriented programming (at least). It has a huge library of nice functions and widgets to add in as you need them - and that's just the official distribution.Lutz introduces us to the language without assuming anything other than that we have a computer and are able to do basic things with it (including accessing the Intartoobs). He writes in a clear and occasionally humorous style, borrowing variable names and such from Monty Python (after whom the language is named), and giving examples that actually demonstrate the points being made - though, aside from that, most of them don't actually _do_ much. (Again, that appears to be reserved for the sequel.)For someone with no programming background, this would probably be a do-able book. For someone like me who has such a background, though out of date, it's definitely right on the beam. (I picked this up because I wanted to learn a reasonably modern programming language; coworkers recommended either this or PHP, and I liked the name of this one better. Seriously...) For an advanced programmer, familiar with languages like Java and C++, it provides clear explanations of how (and occasionally why) Python is different from those languages. (Python has an explicit design and programming philosophy, the \"Zen of Python,\" built into the language as an Easter egg.)There's no real conclusion to be drawn here, other than that if you are interested in learning Python, this is a pretty good place to start. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Learning Python would make a solid choice for a Python programming class that spans several months. Experienced programmers who are looking to add Python to their programming repertoire may want to find a book with a more concise approach. On the plus side Mark identifies a lot of programming \"gotchas\" and successfully covers the differences between the two most popular versions of Python (2.7, and 3.X). Too often though the book dwells on unimportant topics for far too long, and gives other topics a short shrift... the phrase \"we'll cover that in a later chapter\" is easily the most common refrain in the book. A colleague of mine owns an earlier edition of Learning Python and it is several hundred pages shorter... seemingly as Python evolves the new information is added in with little effort to edit the existing content. I didn't really need the lengthy early chapters on why to use Python... I bought a book on Python, I obviously want to learn it. The comparison to other programming languages could be cut down by 75% or more. Topics of interest to me as an experienced programmer, such as multi-threading, and basic UI coding, are conspicuous by their absence. It's not a bad book, there is a lot of information covered here... but it would be better if it was shorter by a third, and covered some more diverse topics at the expense of some of the minutia on simpler topics. I read the whole 1400 pages (theres another 100+ pages of appendices) and felt that I had a reasonable foundation in Python, but that it was a slog getting there, which contrasts with an early chapters insistence that Python is fun. \n",

There is lot of hand-holding.  There is excellent and detailed coverage of the ample differences between the different versions of Python, which I think accounts for most of the rest of the increased page count.  If you're a veteran programmer like me, and want to get off and running quickly, this may not be the book for you; but if you want to learn the language thoroughly and you have time to rehash basics, it's a suitable book.

      "I don't write too many reviews but I have to review this book. I'm just trying to learn the language to do some web, security, and rasberry pi development on my own. I tried to learn python over a year ago, got frustrated and quit. I tried to pick up the language again about 2 weeks ago. I have read and tried to work through Learning Python the Hard Way (LPHW). LPHW is a good resource and it did give me a general understand of the language. It teaches python version 2x. I have also read Dive into Python 3 (DP3). DP3 is also a good resource and it teaches python version 3x. I have also read and referenced  [...] For the most part, I am able to write simple code. But I got frustrated when I tried to review and understand complex code structures. I had a hard time understanding the nuances of the language. I spent hours searching online and watching tutorial videos. But I was constantly frustrated because there were all these exceptions that didn't make sense to me. I kept on asking why this works and why that does not work.The best thing about this book is that it explain the nuances of the language by giving multiple examples. So it does explains it in a complete manner. A lot of other resources will touch upon a topic and then glance over it. I often wondered.. what about this... so a lot of other resources expect you to test the other cases out which in most circumstance will be okay, but in others, you are still left wondering \"why?\". This book does not do that. In fact, I almost didn't need to try the examples on the interactive python command line because it was so thorough.This book is not for the beginner. You will get lost among the trees in the forest because there is so much information in this book. If you are impatient or need to start coding right away, you really won't be able to do this with Learning Python. LPHW and DP3 are much better at getting you up and running. But to write error free code, you have to understand the nuances of the language which Learning Python teaches you. Learning Python the Hard Way (free on the internet) and Dive into Python 3 (also free) are great resources to get introduced to the language. I would recommend both before you delve into this book. But once you get an understand of the basics of python, this book will fill in the missing details.As a disclaimer, I have only been reading this book for a day. I have already read 300 pages. A lot of it was review. But I learned a lot of new stuff as well that filled in the gaps. I have not read the section on regex or the more advanced sections yet so this review is not complete. But so far, I am impressed on the thoroughness of the subject matter.The main grip I have is that I bought the kindle version. If I read it in a linear fashion the material seem to flow nicely. But when I come to certain sections, I need to jump around. You find this a lot with any technical book. The kindle version makes this difficult because I cannot \"easily\" keep track of what I was reading so I get side tracked a lot. I also cannot effectively add notes (yes, I know I can add notes). I ended up using 4 devices to read this book just to keep track of where I was. I may get the hardcopy so that I have an easy quick reference book to look at later at my desk. With a hard copy, I use bookmarkers that I can quickly page to. I know about the kindle bookmarks but they are cumbersome to use. Fortunately, its hard to beat the fact that I can carry this book on my phone if I wanted to. So I would rate the kindle version 3 stars.Overall, I would buy this again on kindle. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Just as a background, I am a software developer with 15 years software development in C, C++, Perl, and some Java moving into a position working with Python for the first time.  I was looking for a good Python \"techniques\" and basic fundamental language guide book, which is why I turned to the O'Reilly line (I have so many of their other books, from Perl to UNIX tools, to Java, etc.)  But, quite frankly, this book by Mark Lutz is very difficult to recommend (skip to the end for the TL;DR).  In a short version, it is very amateur, both from a writing perspective and a software development perspective.For the long version, first the bad points...  The author is either a half-baked software developer, or he is very good at coming across as one.  Statements like \"Python is better because it doesn't have the costly compile and link-time steps that languages like C does\" makes me tilt my head in wonder.  Does he not understand that ALL program execution has to be compiled to machine code?  And that if it is not done at development time, then the user of your code will surely incur that hit at runtime through an interpreter or some virtual machine?  The reason C (and C++, although the author usually names just C) compiles into machine code ahead of time is to save the runtime cost.  This isn't a \"Python is better than C\" issue.  It's a simple tradeoff that any real software developer realizes and makes use of.  If you don't need the runtime speed, then improving development cycle speed is a good thing, yes?  And likewise if you need a fast execution, taking the hit ahead of time so your users don't is worth it.  This is software development, something the author doesn't display a good job of fully understanding.In fact, half of the book reads like this.  From subjective, baseless assertions like \"most programmers prefer single-quotes [to declare literal strings]\" (???  Certainly not in my experience!) to constant \"rah rah\" Python proselytizing over other programming languages (C is a favorite target of his), it all shows a very shaky grasp on the ins and outs of software engineering.  He slams C's memory management and ability to get to the guts of a program, yet that is often required to create a sleek, highly efficient program.  He attacks C's syntax and praises Python's indent-based syntax without addressing the fact that Python tightly binds pretty visual formatting of human-readable code to machine execution flow.  To a seasoned software engineer, this is all about tradeoffs and using the right tool for the job.  Python does MANY things well, some MUCH better than C.  It's about using a hammer on a nail and a driver on a screw.  But you will have to wade through pages of cheer-leading and preaching from the author before you learn to actually USE Python.  If you are a C developer buying this book, you'd want to get to the nuts and bolts and just figure out how to use this tool to accomplish the job.  If not, you wouldn't understand all the constant comparisons and claims of superiority over C anyway.  \"WHY Python?\" the author asks. Because it is the tool to use for this job.  It's that simple.  I don't need the immature and insecure attempts to self-rationalize why Python \"REALLY is great guys, honestly! Much better than 'C'!\"  I just need to know the syntax, libraries, and tips and tricks.Now for the good:  all that latter stuff IS in here.  You just have to wade through the self-actualizing, childish ego-trip to get to the juicy bits.  So, in the end, I'd recommend it if you don't mind fighting your way through what amounts to a half-book's worth of insecurities to find the information you need. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "This is not a book for someone who wants to learn Python in one hour. Python can be an easy language to use but not to fully explain, which this book does. The problem is that methods don't exist without classes and classes don't make sense without methods. Which do you describe first? Python's unprecedented orthogonality exacerbates this. When one method appears in many different classes, it is helpful to understand the method irrespective of class; but no method can be described without reference to some class. In many ways Lutz meets this challenge head on with a matrix organization, which may appear repetitive but is really the only way to fully describe Python. It also makes the book big. If you take the time, it is worth the effort to read this book. \n",

In short, it takes too long to get to the point.  For me, David Beazley is one of the best writers on the subject of computer science (I read his python text but its a bit dated now).  His writing is lean, each sentence packs an important detail, and collectively the sentences convey a bigger idea. \n",

      "Being a Java programmer for 20 years, it’s very difficult to transition to a language like pythonJava has two compilers (compiles to byte code,  then JIT compiler which gives it excellent performance)So, working in a non compiled language is very challenging.  Without compiler to correct syntax and optimize code progress is very slowBut python persists, and eventually I was forced to learn itThe final straw was when Google released its Tensor Processing Unit , TPU, for their AI framework Tensorflow.Tensorflow is written in C++, with a python wrapper.  C++ is the correct choice, as about twice as fast as Java, and 1/3 memory use (depending on which benchmark you use) and maps well to hardware.  The Java interface to C++, is quite tricky,  so they wrapped their tensorflow  with python (which interfaces well with C++).  Python is good at  gluing stuff together.If you want to learn cutting edge AI,  Tensorflow from Google is the way  forward , Their Tensor process unit, TPU,  is the cutting edge.  The interface for Tensorflow is python,  so I am being forced to learn pythonScripting languages are not easy to learn (in my opinion),  hence the need for this large book.Remember, with a scripting language, YOU have to be the compiler,  machine wont do  syntax checking for you (not until run time ),  so you need a large book.but I intend to slog through the book,  as future is going to be python  (at least for AI)Good book,  don’t be put off by author's python sales pitch,  just think AI,  machine learning, access to latest AI stuff using Google Tensorflow  via python and this will motivate you to slog though the  book, and learn this scripting language.Summary:  Python is difficult to learn compared to compiled languages (in my opinion), hence need for large book, and at 1600 pages this is largest book, and well written. \n",

      "Mark Lutz provides a level of detail and explanation on many different topics regarding Python. While helpful for people who may have never programmed before and decided Python is a good language to start with (which it is), a lot of the material here will be review for somebody who has programmed before. That's not to say you should skip the chapters if you have programmed before however, as the way Python does things may be different from how one may expect them to be done (syntax, etc). So a quick gloss over may be very beneficial here.Most of the chapters are easily understandable as the author provides clear context and examples to accompany the topics presented. One of the things I disliked about the book was the author's constant voiced disapproval of C/C++ in this book. While I understand he may not like the language, I don't feel it worth pointing out how the author thinks certain aspects of Python are better than doing a similar task in C/C++. It's not needed in this book and serves no purpose. Somebody learning Python from this book already has a reason for wanting to learn it. \n",

      "I quit. I got to page 910 and quit. It's too much. I learned some, obviously. But I never felt like I was learning to code; I was just learning about Python. There is so much material, some basic and most quite advanced, that I could never get a complete idea about how to implement anything. I would suppose this book would be good for someone who has coded Python for a while, but not as a \"Learning...\" book.A bit of background on me so you can get my point of reference: I've been through Charles Severance's book \"Python for Informatics\" and his Coursera course based on that book (beginning level). I'm slow at climbing learning curves but I'm not stupid (I got a 4.0 in my undergrad, I have a Masters, I taught myself two languages, I wrote five books). I'm studying CIS just for fun at a local college and I wanted to learn Python because I want to play around with OSInt (e.g., Michael Bazzell's book) and information security stuff to see if I could find applications for the same in my current job. I tend to learn best from books and then take what I learn in the books and apply it in projects or by hands-on experience.I was lost from the start in \"Learning Python.\" After about 400 to 500 pages, I wasn't coding anything. So, I signed up for Codecademy's Python course as a kind of \"lab\" to simply put my fingers on keys and code something. I continued to plow through \"Learning Python\" until yesterday when I hit page 910... and I realized I had over 500 pages to go... and I quit. (Yes, in my frustration I turned to comfort food and abused my body... I'm better now, though.) I agree with the guy who said in his review that trying to learn Python from this book is like trying to learn to speak English by reading a dictionary. A dictionary is helpful (very much so), but it's an awful way to try to actually learn the language.I ended up very frustrated. I wasted a lot of time and energy that could have been better spent on something more helpful, practical, useful, etc.I ordered \"Fundamentals of Python\" by Kenneth Lambert as my next attempt at learning Python. The book is several years old, but it got good reviews here and it seems to be a bit more of a practical approach. If I remember to do so, I'll come back here and write an update when I'm finished with his book so anyone reading this can at least have my opinion on another option.Very disappointed in this book. As big as it is and as thorough as it appears, I had hopes of really learning Python well with \"Learning Python.\" And I didn't. I quit.EDIT / UPDATE:Okay, here are the resources I found that worked better for me than Learning Python.1. Python for Informatics by Dr. Charles R Severance and the Coursera course (or specialization) that Dr. Chuck teaches. This is by far the best resource (book + Coursera) that I found to learn Python for my needs. Very well written. Very well taught. Easy to understand, digest, and (best of all) apply. Highly recommended.Python for Informatics: Exploring Information2. Introducing Python by Bill Lubanovic. This is another O'Reilly book (like Learning Python) and, as such, is outstanding. I find this book to be \"Learning Python how it should be.\" It covers basically the same topics as Learning Python, but without the confusing depth and minute details. It has a bunch of exercises at the end of each chapter that let you practice with the concepts taught in the chapter. Great book.Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages3. Web Scraping with Python by Ryan Mitchell. After you get through a beginning book or two (like the two above), then it might be helpful to start a \"project\" book. This is the one I got and it's good. O'Reilly again. Well written. Short. Simple. But, whatever works for you (it might not be web scraping, but getting some projects going helps to apply the skills learned).Web Scraping with Python: Collecting Data from the Modern Web \n",

      "As I have come to expect from all O'Reilly publications this is a very considered and detailed book which does as the title promises help you learn Python.The approach, level of detail and structure/organisation of the book suits my learning style.I'm reading this book (am yet to complete it) after completing a short Uni course that required some knowledge in how to code in Python and after reading a few specific \"how to's\" on the web.For me this book made more immediate sense to me as it helped fill in the gaps that were created as I raced my way through stackoverflow posts in order complete my Uni assignments.Python reminds me a lot of older languages like C in that it can be comprehended quite easily in a short amount of time. Python however differs from these older languages in that it has a lot of functionality \"built into\" the language like lists and dictionaries that I expect will make mastering Python a bit more challenging and take a little bit longer - and this is where I was looking for a book to complement my learning.Learning Python by Mark Lutz has achieve this for me to date; however I have a long way to go before completing the book. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I am an experienced Perl programmer and I am quite familiar with the basic tenets of programming.  I decided recently it was time to learn Python and so I purchased this book due to the overall positive reviews.  I knew the book was kind of large (over 1500+ pages) but this didn't bother me.  I figured it was probably full of great examples and covered more advanced topics in detail.  Not so.  This book is exceedingly verbose, unfulfilling and essentially empty.  The examples are scattered and never quite stitched together to give you a sense of actual programming in Python.  For example, I learned Perl with the book \"Learning Perl in 24 hrs\".  This book gave ample page long examples of actual programs that were numbered by line.  The next page or two would then have explanations for each line of code -- mostly a review of what you have already learned but also introducing new concepts.  This book would be served well by such practices.Also, I was interested in regular expression/pattern matching in Python.  Despite the hundreds of pages waisted in this book the author dedicates only half a page to the 're' module claiming it's \"an advanced tool outside this book's scope.\"  What!!! Further, the section on loops is also poorly organized and filled with fluff.  I could go on but i think my frustration is evident.  Read the other reviews and you will see a trend.  Avoid this book. \n",

      "Mark Kutz has wriiten the best book on a programming language that I haver ever read. Everyone who Works with Python should read this book. He is so in depth that he answered a problem I had with an industrial control some 10 years ago. We really were wondering if the control was haunted as it seemed to have a mind of his own. One reviewer complained the the first chapter had sentences such as \"More about that later\" and that bothered him. The chapter clearly states that it is a preview and that is what it is. Mark is fantastic with details such as how a variable is a reference to an object and the subtle difference between these and variables and pointers in C and how variables in Python do not have any type. They reference an object that has a type which can change dynamically but Python is strongly typed. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Caveat - I've been programming since 1992 in C/C++, Pascal, Java, PHP and have recently decided it's time to learn Python.  This review is intended for those that know basic programming principlesThis book probably has more content about Python than you will ever need.  The problem is, it makes for very dense reading as Mark tries to appeal to too broad an audience, both newbies to programming and veterans.  This means he laboriously explains all the basics AND all of the minute details of the language.  This means learning basics like methods and classes takes many more hours of reading than it should.Mark's style is: when in doubt to be verbose.  If there are three ways to do something in Python, all three methods are explained in detail (sometimes multiple times) and the \"pythonic\" or \"best practice\" often saved until all are explained in full detail.  For example, Mark spends multiple pages on the difference between __str__ and __repr__ (two methods you can override for class output) across several chapters, rather than just concisely explaining to use __repr__ most of the time, explain the difference and maybe a sidebar/appendix on the minutia of why \"most of the time\" you should just use __repr__ but there are a few exceptions.Going back, I realized another reviewer summed it up perfectly -- \"It's like learning the English language by reading a dictionary.\"DO buy this book if you want to have a reference dictionary that has ever minute detail about Python.DON'T buy this book if you are new to the language and want to get going quickly.I've moved to just writing the code and following online tutorials, and when I run into a problem I don't understand diving into the book to try to find the reasons. \n",

The best way to learn a language is to get hands on and start coding, fun exercises that are a great way to do that. But this book has really dull Q&A at many chapters, after a length explanation of concepts. It's almost unreadable. It's like the author is more interested in demonstrating how much he knows, rather than actually having you learn.

      " Review: \n",
      "Not that great. First of all, Python seems to be a very non-standard product. This book gets wound up trying to describe one version over the other too much too often. It would have been better to make two books, one for each version. The reader is cautioned to consider using one version only and try to avoid even reading the other versions examples if they are a new user.An unusual complaint of mine would be that this book uses complex words where simple ones would have been more correct. Example, random would have been better than arbitrary. When it doubt the reader needs to suspect a simple or general meaning instead of over thinking it's use.Another issue is too many references to C programming. The sample code is nice but in many cases the reader has to discover if the code had meaning by example or is in correct position.  A simple example may be dict, does it mean a special term to python? The reader is left to decide how the example name fits in the coding.  Many example of the use of name and actual code are mixed. I would have preferred it to have never used coding words in examples. Using the help() function gives clues to when a programming word is used in an example. Some code examples may fail due to line spacing that didn't seem to be explained very well. Lucky for the reader, python examples tended to fail and report why and indent code.If one follows with one or two versions of python on some versions of OS's they may or may not get the results posted in the book. (back to crazy python source) So, to the reader, don't get too worried if your results don't match the book but each time you will have to question or test yourself as to did you do wrong or is version wrong. Too many times the author points the reader to the python manual for resolution of coding. (have it handy)As others have stated, this is not a learning python book but a book about python. Knowing other coding and other technical material actually may harm the reader.There may not be a better book to use. The use of this book was suggested as part of a semester class by the author. For my use I only wanted to write a very specialized program. I was able to utilize this book for my purpose so in that sense the book did it's job. Since others regard it well I'll have to assume it is a good book to either have or know about.If you got this from the library and only have 3 weeks to read it, you'd better get after it. I had to buy it because I didn't get through it that fast. :) \n",

THIS book is finally the one that step-by-step in a good old school-teacher way is the perfect fit for me.

      " Review: \n",
      "Another reviewer said that trying to learn Python from this book is like trying to learn english by reading the dictionary, and that couldn't be more true. Each discrete topic is covered in minute detail, so it isn't until page 500 or so of this 1500+ page book that you will have covered enough of the basics to write even a simple program. One of Python's strongest selling points is that it's easy to jump in and get programming right away, regardless of prior knowledge, so this book's approach is a major turn-off for anyone that wants to learn through practice and experience.Speaking of which, readers will need to have at least some previous programming experience to make sense of this book, since it relies heavily on jargon that complete beginners are unlikely to understand. If you don't already know what functions, methods, strings, and such are (and experienced programmers here will laugh, but when you are first starting out, such terms can be confusing!) the author isn't going to explain, or if he does, it will be 200 pages later in a different section.A more minor complaint is the dry and formal, textbook-like voice of the author. I don't need to be constantly entertained while learning, but I do need to have fun, and a little humor and personality go a long way.I'm over a hundred pages in, and I give up. I need to actually program while learning to program. I was looking for a beginner friendly, tutorial style book that would encourage exploration and test my knowledge with quizzes. This isn't it. I think I will go back to my severely outdated copy of Beginning Python by Magnus Lie Hetland to brush up on basic program construction, then use this book as a reference as I get deeper into programming with Python. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Whenever I learn a new programming language, I look for these types of big, comprehensive books that cover every aspect of the language. Not only will they teach you the language, but they serve as great references later on when you quickly need to look something specific up.This book definitely fits the mold. It takes you from the very basics of Python programming to the advanced features. It's, in theory, exactly what I was looking for. So why only 3 stars? Because it's absurdly long. Almost 1500 pages when you take out the Appendices and Index. For a language that is allegedly so simple and straightforward, how on earth does it take 1500 pages to explain it?By comparison, look at \"Essential C# 7.0\". This book covers a more complicated language, and clearly differentiates the features added in the SEVEN different versions of the language (far better than this book does comparing Python 2 and Python 3), in 1000 pages. Even Stroustrup's definitive C++ reference book is only 1300 pages, and C++ 11 is far, far more complex than Python.The problem, as several others have pointed out, is that the author dedicates a ridiculous amount of text reminding you about something you learned in a previous chapter (or even something he described two paragraphs ago!), or bringing up a feature only to not explain it and state that it will be covered in some later chapter. No doubt this annoying practice by the author contributed HUNDREDS of additional pages to the book. Whoever the editors were on this book, they completely fell asleep at the wheel.So yes, this will teach you the ins-and-outs of the Python language, but man oh man do you have to wade through endless amounts of fluff to get to it. \n",

      "I am new to the Python language but have messed with it here and there in the past very lightly. I decided that I REALLY want to know Python from the inside out. On that note, while this book is heavy, and at time repetitive (repetition is key) it has allowed me to see the inner workings of Python. My suggestion on this read is to go through it analytically and try every example since we all know that typing the syntax of code by practicing will help write code correctly. I live my life comparing things that I don't understand to that which I do. If you just want to pick up an instrument like a guitar and produce music then you can download tabs. if you want to write a composition of music so you can play your own music then learning music theory and music composition is the route to take. For me, I am taking the angle of getting deep into the understanding of learning the keyboard signs used in python, the programming construct and code block layouts, useful well know functions and method calls, etc. The tediousness of this process will payoff on the other side of this adventure. When one wants to know something \"time\" is set aside and forgotten. For those complaining about getting bored, or that it takes to much time to know something you don't know then maybe Python is not your focus. Read it, digest it, and own it. \n",

This 1600 pager is quite a bit to work through but it is thorough and Mr. Lutz brings you along with the details.  The pace is slow and methodical. I like that because it is how I learn.

      " Title: Overly long text on the Python language, not much about programming in Python \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "The book covers the Python language in detail, buts its way too long and the organization makesit a boring read. And you won't learn much about actually programming in Python.The first 90 pages explain how to run a Python program, followed by six chapters (220 p.) of Pythonbuilt-in data types, then another six chapters on basic syntax, before even getting to functions onpage 473.  For object-oriented programming in Python, you need to wade through another 300 pageson functions, generators, and modules.Python is not that complicated.  You don't need a 1500 page book to learn it well, in my opinion.I learned more from the tutorial and docs at python.org, then reading the book \"Fluent Python\".If you love programming languages or want to know the details of Python syntax and semantics,you may enjoy this book.  If you want to learn how to program in Python, look elsewhere. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I learned and wrote some ActionScript about a decade ago and have hacked away at PHP for years so I understand OOP and the basics of coding.  This book layers up the knowledge nicely and I'm finding it easy to learn Python with it.  I like that he discusses a topic in a little detail then informs readers that more on that topic will be available in later chapters.  When he gets to the next level of detail on that topic he reviews a little and then digs deeper.I would recommend that those who are completely new to coding find a basic coding book or online course that creates a product / full application of some kind before starting this book.  Once you have the basic concept of making magic happen you'll be oriented in this book.  First build something cookbook style.I'm using the Kindle version but will probably also buy the paper behemoth.  The problem with the Kindle version is that I don't see my place in the chapter, only the whole 1,500 page book.  I like to know how many more pages until I finish the chapter so I can allocate my study time better.  Poor user experience design by both O'Reilly and Amazon.  However, the Kindle version is certainly more convenient if you study at coffee shops, etc and nice to have highlighting, bookmarks, and notes in the Kindle app. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Update:I think my earlier review deserves an update. After spending 6 months in a position working with Python professionally, I've revisited the book and found that it offers value to me now. For example, as a beginner, I was not interested in a 4.5 page analysis of tradeoffs between '.format()' and '%' formatting. However, coming back with an intermediate level of knowledge this is something that matters to me. Across many topics, the discussion of finer points of the language is now a relevant topic, that this books does not shy away from discussing topics in minutia.This book is let down by its title which suggests that it's a good book for a beginning programmer. Because of the depth of topic exploration, this is really a book for intermediate programmers.Old review:It's OK, but far too wordy. I prefer technical books to be concise and to the point. Unfortunately, this one is not. It is 1500 pages that I honestly think could be covered in 500-700 pages. The information is good, but it's all so long and drawn out that it makes for excruciating reading. \n",

It reads like like a reference textbook for academics who wants to know all the little details. The downside to this style, is it is not friendly to beginners that are without a mentor. It is like trying to learn a subject from the dictionary. You will be be so confused if you try to read this book from cover to cover ...and beginners have no clue on which subjects they should skim over.Again, it is a good book....but do not buy this as your first book. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "The problem with the whole \"there's too much\", \"it's too complicated\", \"like reading a dictionary\", \"just want to start coding already!\" line of criticism is that Python is one of the most, if not the most, programmer-friendly languages around with thousands of tutorials, day projects, quickstart guides, cheatsheets, etc for people of all ages and skill levels. They're available for free all over the internet. So there's obviously no lack of the material these critics desire.This book is for those like me who already pondered over Python on Wikipedia, tackled some simple projects, read a few cheatsheets and tutorials, and looked up answers on Stack Overflow, but felt that it was time to really settle in with the language and get down to business. This book is very thorough (and for those who want even more, there's the official Python documentation), well-written, and easy to follow.It feels much easier to get through than dry documentation. The book might look intimidating but there's a lot of hand-holding and explaining. For those who are already experienced programmers, there's another book by Mark Lutz titled \"Python Pocket Reference\" which might be more appropriate.A serious investment in time and effort must be made to read this book from start to end, but it's worth it. I felt like I was making good progress in understanding the language with each new page. \n",

      " Title: The Aircraft Carrier of Python Books \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "Note: This review was written as part of O'Reilly's Reader Review program. I got the book for free, but nobody told me to like it.This book is an aircraft carrier. Huge and massive, calmly floating in the sea of smaller Python tutorials and frameworks, it gives you as long a runway as you need until you're ready to take off into Python on your own. My own sweet spot occurred around the 50% mark - I got halfway through the book, into Part VI, Classes and OOP, when I realized I can now easily understand Python code snippets I find floating around the Web, and so move on to other resources.Lutz is a calm, patient instructor, and the book never feels rushed. It is meant to be read in sequence, rather than used as a reference you jump around in. Part I, Getting Started, takes its time setting Python in context. It sells the language, explaining why you might want to use it. Part II covers object types in depth, from humble strings and numbers to tuples and files. This is an interesting part, especially if you already code: It felt like a review of stuff I already know, but I kept an open mind and did gain a much better understanding of tuples, the side effects of assigning to mutable types from within functions, and more.Part III covers general Python syntax, and takes an in-depth look at how iterators work in Python. A lot of it is not stuff you strictly need to know to start, but once you do know it, you gain a better understanding of why the code you read works like it does.Part IV discusses functions, and contained one of the books biggest a-ha moments, for me: I finally truly understood what a closure is, and how it works. If you already know closures, this may seem basic. But I had a difficult time when I previously tried to understand it using other sources, so having it explained in Lutz's patient, methodical style made it far more accessible for me. A major win.Part IV is also where I started having trouble with the book's methodical approach, for the first time feeling the need to skip ahead: Chapter 20's intense coverage of comprehensions and generators didn't feel like it offers knowledge I would use in the real world, at least not as a beginner-intermediate Python coder. Chapter 21 goes into very in-depth detail regarding benchmarking, which is something that I absolutely don't need to know about as I get my start in Python (build something first, optimize it later).At first I was disappointed this was happening, but looking back on it, it feels like I was beginning to take flight. I wasn't quite ready to leave the book behind me yet, but I was developing better judgment about which parts are important and which aren't, for me. I felt impatient with the book at this point, but ploughed on.Part V explores modules and packages, but from a very theoretical standpoint, in that it doesn't say anything about pip and distribute and the other real-world tools you're going to need to install third-party packages. Its in-depth explanation about the module search path is helpful, but mainly serves as background.Finally, part VI offers an overview of OOP, starting with the very concept. Lutz doesn't assume you know what OOP is all about, and takes time to lay out the difference between object-based code to true object-oriented code. It offers clear explanations for the syntax used in defining and instantiating classes, shows exactly how inheritance works, and shows how simple (and optional) Python OOP is. I got up to page 817 (out of around 1500 total) before I felt I was ready to move on and get started with other resources.Here's a good example of the book's academic style: Early on in part VI, Lutz takes lots of time to explore operator overloading in classes (making your class understand built-in Python operators). This isn't something you're going to want to do, especially when getting started, and yet Lutz really digs into it. On the other hand, decorators, which you will see ALL the time getting started with frameworks such as Flask, are only covered in part VIII. I am sure Lutz has a good reason for this, but it fails the test of real-world use. Spending time grasping topics I won't be using while neglecting something that's crucial for beginners is just not good study time management.In general, I would say you need to know how to approach this book to really benefit from it. I recommend heeding Lutz's initial recommendation, to read the book sequentially, but only until you feel it starts getting in the way.I feel that forcing yourself to read the whole book sequentially can sap your Python experience of its spontaneity and energy - Python is a *fast* language, it's easy, it's dynamic, it's basically fun to play with. Don't ruin it for yourself by insisting on reading the whole thing, because it may end up seeming far harder than it really is.That said, where Learning Python truly excels is in covering the basics. You don't just learn how things work, but why they work as they do, too. I feel I've gained a far deeper, more meaningful understanding of Python's core concepts and nuances than I would have otherwise, and am now ready to tackle some real code. In the future, if I ever feel like I'm losing height or stalling, I will probably land back onto this spacious aircraft carrier and go in for some maintenance. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "You might get 3-stars worth of value out of this book once you're up and running with Python and need to look up some advanced concepts. But this book is structured without and regard to how people actually learn to use a programming language and why they do it. The author states that he expects the reader to spend \"at least weeks and probably months\" going through the material in the book and cautions that that is just the beginning - only then will you be ready for \"Programming Python\".In fact, most of us turn to a new programming language when we have a more immediate need. And this approach to Python really sells the language short - especially if you have some programming experience, you can get up and running in no time and build up knowledge of the conventions and libraries as you gain experience. I recommend you find a book with a more modern teaching style that gets you to jump right in with some code and builds up bits and pieces as you go, starting with the most practical concepts. This is a more fun and useful way to learn as you are reinforcing knowledge through practice. In contrast, Learning Python's 10th chapter is entitled \"Introducing Python Statements\" and \"Function Basics\" kicks in at chapter 16 on page 473! \n",

      "I really want to give this book 5 stars.  It has everything one needs to understand Python in detail.  There's no doubt that the author Mark Lutz is a Python uber-Guru.  However it's 1500 pages long primarily due to a writing style that drove me nuts and often put me to sleep.  Incredibly verbose and with a total absence of any economy of words, Mark often manages to confuse as he explains something in different ways.  I strongly recommend that the author go through the book and ruthlessly cut out at least 500 pages, ideally a lot more. Each sentence that adds repetition should be treated like cancer and cut out.  Doing this would make the whole reader experience and absorption of material fast and crisp, rather than soggy and doughy.  Ironically, I really appreciated the q&a exercises at the end of each chapter, because these are in effect a crisp summary of key points.  However we need this not at the end of the chapter, but throughout.  I cannot imagine reading the other tome that I have also purchased by the same author - in fact I am not going to punish myself. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "If this were the book \"Programming Python,\" the level of content may make sense.  As this is in the \"Learning\" series, I feel like the level of information is too high.  What I would expect from this series is that I could open a book, read a passage to someone who has never touched code before in their life, and they could understand it.  When I read a passage on one of the compiler flavors of Python (page 35ish) to several people in this category, I was not surprised that they had no idea what I was talking about.This... works in my favor.  I'm a software developer who needed to learn Python for work.  A coworker already had this book, so I thought I would end up skimming through the \"let's introduce the concept of OOP and loops,\" but from what I can see so far, this book reads more like a Programming series book.  I often wonder at the size of Learning Python and Programming Python, if Learning is really a blend of Learning and Programming, and Programming should be the Master series.  Reading the author, Mark Lutz's bio, it becomes clear why it's written this way.  He's about 21 years removed from being a noob at Python, let alone programming.  As I said, this works out in my favor, cause I get a detailed technical description of Python in a learning series :D, none-the-less, I am rating this based on how the books marketing is presented, how O'Reilly Media series books usually read, and the expectation that real beginners to programming in general will pick this up and have absolutely no idea what he's talking about.If the content were skimmed down on the slow introduction of syntax and concepts, leaving the technical talk about Python and implementation choices, renamed to \"Programming Python,\" and split into a proper series, this would get 5 stars. :) \n",

      "Before I begin, I would like to mention that I am a current undergrad student who is majoring in physics and mathematics, so I am not writing from the perspective of a computer science expert. I obtained an interest in learning python because of scipy and after working with many other graduate students who warned me about relying on proprietary software.I found a used copy of this book at a book store and decided to use it to learn python in my spare time. However, I soon found that the actual python website had a better introduction - at least in my opinion. The main problem with this book is that it is written too informally. For example, the three initial chapters mostly express the author's love of python, dislike of other languages, and opinions on open source projects.The other thing I disliked was the rate at which information is introduced. Yes, you will learn python, but you will be learning everything at a very slow pace. Regardless if you are a beginner, the information presented is not concise enough. Again, this could just be a result of the author being too informal, but it is really frustrating if you just want something that is straightforward.In summary, if you enjoy reading work that is written as if you were having a conversation with the narrator, then by all means ignore my review. However, if you are like me and want something that is presented as concise and formal, then my suggestion is that you pass on this book. \n",

      "Learning Python, now in its fifth edition, is a humongous tome that covers Python 2 and 3. In covering both versions of Python, it does a tremendous service to the beginner. As a new Python programmer who's well-versed with other programming languages, I found the book easy to get up to speed with, and its verbosity and thoroughness an asset rather than a liability.Part 2 of the book has excellent coverage of basic types and data structures. Having read Parts 1 and 2, Parts 3, 4, and 5 seem repetitive sometimes, and are probably most useful as a reference.Chapter 3 makes a quick reference to pdb and Winpdb, but the coverage of debuggers is otherwise quite sparse. Debugging multithreaded apps without a good debugger is a pain. Not a huge omission as the book does not cover multithreading.Chapter 9 covers the json module briefly, but the book covers neither socket nor httplib/http.client modules. Network and web programming are required knowledge even for beginners these days. Programming Python, by the same author, does cover these topics in great detail.Chapter 25 covers advanced topics regarding modules, such as using dual mode code for implementing tests, but that is about the only coverage of unit testing you'll find in the book. It refers you to the official documentation for modules such as unittest and doctest.I found Test Your Knowledge Quiz and Answers at the end of each chapter useful. After having read syntax highlighted code in books such as Python Cookbook, I found the code samples in the book rather dull.I thank O'Reilly Media for providing the book for review. \n",

I choose this book to review although it was this big, because Python knowledge is in huge demand lately and also because I am totally new with the language. This book is not the only book you'll need to learn programming in Python, but it is a great foundation. As this book is updated frequently (this is already the 5th Edition of the book) you can find also up-to-date information about Python. This book also covers nicely the 2.x/3.x story and when there is a difference between the two, it is nicely explained.I really enjoyed reading this book. I now feel that I have a good basis to become a Python programmer. The book almost read like a roman - which is a partly the reason that it has 1600 pages - but it explains all the different things really nice and if you already now about the story behind something you can easily skip such sections.I read in some reviews that people were annoyed by the repetition of some topics, but I personally like that because the time between reading page 50 and page 1500 will be not a couple of days, and in the meantime I forgot some details, and this helped me instead of annoy me.

Brand new programmers might need certain chapters in this work more than programmers who are used to another language and vice versa.  For example, chapter 2 and 3 are ones that can probably be skipped by experienced programmers about how to get a language up and running on their machines.  Coverage of many topics are broad.  I really enjoyed the chapters discussing generator functions and expressions.  Part 8 of the book is titled 'Advanced Topics'.  If I were a new programmer, I would consider skipping the deeper sections and coming back to them in time.  It is nice that this book covers a lot of topics-it means that you might have some room to grow with this title as you learn more Python.Overall conclusion: Consuming the more advanced sections as one learns more Python and the rest in small chucks makes this a solid work that has a lot of information to get one programming in Python.Disclaimer:  I got a copy of this book for review as part of O'Reilly blogger program. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I am taking the MOOC edX online course from MIT in Computer Science with python, 6.00.1x.  I choose to read this book as a companion to the course material.  This book made the course very easy to take.  The \"endless\" detail on each subject presented my Mark Lutz was very helpful. I highly recommend reading this book to understand the scope as well as the details.The only suggestion I could offer back to the author is that the detail around generators and the use of the yield statement was missing.  While the chapters on OOP were the most helpful to me. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "If you ever want to say honestly, \"I really know Python\", then you are going to need this book. One can program in Python with just a superficial understanding of the language, just as one can use an equation without knowing how it was derived by just plugging in the variables. But, as the complexity of real world problems one tackles with Python increases, I think a deeper understanding of the language is necessary. That's why this book is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Mark Lutz does an excellent job of providing that understanding. There is a lot of information. Take what you need at the moment, discard the rest. But have this book nearby for when you need more information. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "If it takes this guy 1500 pages to teach a simple language like Python, then what does that say about the teacher? He's in his own world. A blabbermouth. There's nothing decent about this book. It's next to impossible to find anything really useful because he just dips his toe into the water on various topics and never gets to really \"swimming\". But you drown in his text, smothered by heaps of bloat and crap.I bought this with several other much shorter books and when I found something interesting in those little books - I'd look to this huge book to see some further explanation only to find that the thing that interests me isn't even mentioned in Lutz's book! For instance, there's a great method for manipulating strings called \"partition\" which is nowhere to be found. Anything that I was interested in simply couldn't be found in this book and if I did happen to find anything of interest to me, it was covered so briefly that even Python Visual Quickstart Guide (only 200 pages) did a far, far better job.This book is sooooo bad. Do yourself a favor and skip it completely.Worthless book! \n",

Unfortunately, \"big,\" in this case, does not translate to \"inclusive.\" It tackles each topic in staggering amounts of detail at the cost of leaving out functional elements of programming that you'd expect in an introductory text (such as, for example, coding with a GUI). For the whole picture, you have to also pick up this book's sequel, Programming Python, which is equally massive. I did not pick up a Python book this size thinking I'd need two of them. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Overall it's the best (if not only) really *deep* language tutorial (not about standard libraries or applications). It's rather theoretical than case based. Also I recommend to read it as a second book - python is easy to grasp very fast. So there are a lot of concise books for brief intro. For not a complete beginner I would recommend Think Python by Allen B. Downey (brilliant exercises with a lot of solution code).- This book is from a professional coach so you can find a lot of repetition, talking about the same in different words, step-by-step approach (intro in a topic and later detailed discussion - files, modules etc.), separation of different cases - like try/except, try/finally, try/except/finally).- The book is about 1600 pages so expect very detailed discussion that you probably do not find in many other sources. Can you use from if you reload module? If you like brief reference it's not for you. But if you like to dig very deep - it's close to ideal resource. Also I personally enjoy sections where he discusses 'Why questions'. Why should we use generators?- You don't find labs or realistic code. All examples are straight to the point and simplified just to illustrate a topic. But there are a lot of them. Many topics have its 'in action' paragraph where you can work with the language in interactive prompt. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "It's been awhile since I read something that badly written in computer books.Don't get me wrong the guy knows his stuff and there is a lot of information hidden in there.Unfortunately it is truly hidden in unnecessary repetitions and fluff.It is not a book or reference or tutorial, this is something like a notes from Mark Lutz class, that he teaches. While in the class it is totally ok to revisit previous topics or not get distracted by advanced concepts in the book repetition and \"I'll talk about it later\" becomes super painful. Dear author, It's the book I can re-read previous topics as needed, there is no need to repeat it 20 times (and this is not an exaggeration).In fact the most used phrase- which you will meet on average twice per page is \"more on * later\" and \"as we discussed previously/(in chapter *)\". If you don't believe me do a regular expression search on it.This book would've been so much better if it was 1/5 in size with topics staying together (we have 3 places/chapters for strings in different places in the book and don't even get me started on classes presentation structure).Also it looks a little biased toward 2.6 version and old ways (% vs format for instance), the very important point of being able to re-use positional anchor with format statement is not even mentioned as an advantage \"{0}={0}.value\".format(\"var\") for example cannot do it with % have to type \"var\" twice. \n",

      "\"Learning Python\" was one of the books that helped me get started in Python and it continues the superb quality of books that OReilly 'Learning' series produces. It gives detail and clear explanation of different aspects of the language plus many bite size examples, with interactive prompt whenever possible. A notable difference from previous edition is that it spends considerable amount of pages comparing 2.x and 3.x, which is necessary for moving people into the Python 3.x space for sure.As someone who doesn't code for food and just using the language as an enabler, I frequently encounter colleagues and peers who wants recommendation as the first book for getting into the language. As a personal preference, this is 'not' the book I would recommend, perhaps the second or third book. Dont get me wrong, it is a good investment of your time, but if you are brand new to the language, you cant just read the first few chapters and start using the language. At 1600 pages, it doesn't get into Python statements (if/else, while) until almost 400 pages into the book. By comparison, the third edition was 752 pages and the latest edition of 'Learning Perl' was 390 pages. I appreciate nesting, duck typing, and Polymorphism as much as the next guy, but perhaps a bit top heavy for people similar to my background to begin with.Other than my small complain, this is a good overall value for your time and money.

Skip all notes at the bottom. Seriously, if the author thinks it's not important to be put in the main text (which has a lot don't deserve to be in the main text), skip the notes.4. Read codes first. If confused, read the sentences and explanations. Otherwise, skip the paragraphs and move on.tl;dr: First read codes. If confused, read the explanations. Think about opportunity cost. It matters a lot.If you're a complete beginner, DON'T READ THIS BOOK. You will spend weeks reading it and won't be able to write print('Hello World\") until chapter who-knows-when.Background: I have read \"Automating the boring stuff with Python\" before reading this book. I have finished reading this book. Before I begin my very critical review for this book, let me say that I have a lot of respect for the author. He's been promoting and teaching Python for more than a decade, and I truly appreciate his contribution and work.#1: BIGGEST PROBLEM: Mistaken technical and detailed with verboseness. This book is extremely verbose, with massive amount of fillers and meaningless sentences. The author mistakes detailed and technical with verbose. This is a big problem. The following are snippets of examples of how verbose this whole book is:...We’ll preview class-based alternatives and meet function attributes later in this chapter, and get the full story on arguments and defaults in Chapter 18.When we meet classes in Part VI, we’ll see similar techniques......more on this table in Chapter 22 and Chapter 25...In fact, as we’ll see in Part VI......as we learned in Chapter 6...If you’ve forgotten why this works, flip back to “Tuples” in Chapter 4 and Chapter 9, and “Assignment Statements” in Chapter 11.Since we’re going to see a more realistic example of this later in this chapter, in “Emulating the Python 3.X print Function,” I’ll postpone the rest of this story until then. For an additional example of keyword-only arguments in action, see the iteration options timing case study in Chapter 21. And for additional function definition enhancements in Python 3.X, stay tuned for the discussion of function annotation syntax in Chapter 19.To see why, stay tuned for Part VI....watch for coverage of these in Chapter 30 and Chapter 31These are advanced features that we won’t delve into in more detail here; see reference texts and Python’s standard manuals for more information, and watch for more on exceptions in Part VII.There is additional perspective on this issue in the exercises at the end of this chapter—which we’ve officially reached....Yes, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The following is copied straight from the book without any modification. Brace for it:\"Because the rest of the comprehensions story relies upon underlying concepts we’re not yet prepared to address, we’ll postpone further details until later in this book. In Chapter 8, we’ll meet a first cousin in 3.X and 2.7, the dictionary comprehension, and I’ll have much more to say about all comprehensions—list, set, dictionary, and generator—later on, especially in Chapter 14 and Chapter 20. As we’ll learn there, all comprehensions support additional syntax not shown here, including nested loops and if tests, which can be challenging to understand until you’ve had a chance to study larger statements.\"\"When we code our own iterable objects with classes later in the book (Chapter 30), we’ll see that multiple iterators are usually supported by returning new objects for the iter call; a single iterator generally means an object returns itself. In Chapter 20, we’ll also find that generator functions and expressions behave like map and zip instead of range in this regard, supporting just a single active iteration scan. In that chapter, we’ll see some subtle implications of one-shot iterators in loops that attempt to scan multiple times—code that formerly treated these as lists may fail without manual list conversions.\"What is the point of this paragraph? A lot phrases are in the future tense: \"We’ll look\", \"We'll be seeing examples\"... but at the present, when you are reading the words, you won't be actually looking and seeing examples. They will come later. So... why even bother mentioning?From Chapter 18, \"If you’ve forgotten how modules and imports work, see the introduction in Chapter 3, or stay tuned for in-depth coverage in Part V\". At this point I am just glad that the author doesn't explain what a dictionary is every time a dict comes up...Moderation in structure is highly desirable; over structured is bad and just waste time. Why would you think the readers would need to know these in advance? I will know when I read Chapter 10. Is this piece of heads-up or information really helpful? Luckily the author doesn't end every paragraph with \"So this is all I have to say for this paragraph. Let's move on to the next paragraph.\"\"This chapter is about functions. Functions can be embedded in a class, which we'll look at in Chapter 30, which is a detailed look at class; function contains statements, which we'll look at at Chapter 20, as you don't have enough knowledge to look at yet; but as we've seen in Chapter 5, 7 and 11, we can now partially look at functions' syntax, which is different from being in a class (again, more on this in Chapter 30). Stay tune for the class chapter!\"You will laugh painfully if you've read this author's work. If the author chips away all this verboseness and \"irrelevant materials\" and mistaken \"technical\" with \"verbose\", the book can at least be cut 20% less, making it less intimidating, more effective and efficient.#2: Too Broad of Audience in MindWhen the writer is writing, I think his intended audiences are:Linear readers, non-linear readers, completely new to programming, Python 2 programmers, Python 3 programmers, Developers with prior C experience, Intermediate programmers.You can see many of them are overlapping and mutually exclusive, probably hence the verboseness.This book jumbles everything together into one brick wall. It's trying to please anyone and everyone who is \"related to Python\": beginning to Python, intermediate programmers who know other languages, former C programmers etc.The author suggests a linear read, yet he constantly provides indexes (basically problem #1 above), like \"As we have seen in Chapter 21; we mentioned this in Chapter 5\". Indexes are only needed if the chapters are independent. Then I realized why for such verboseness. In Chapter 39:For nonlinear readers, we first studied keyword arguments in Chapter 18, and for readers working with the book examples package, some filenames in this chapter are again implied by the command-lines that follow their listings.So this book is written for both linear and non-linear readers. But the author explicitly stated that this book should be read in a linear fashion. So he tried to please both linear and non-linear readers. But linear and non-linear are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. How can a book be read both linearly and non-linearly? Well this book tried and failed fantastically.It baffles me greatly that when you suggest readers to read in a linearly fashion, why would you add pointers back and forth throughout almost every paragraph?In conclusion, this book should be called \"What Marks Knows about Python\". The author just dumps everything he knows about Python. It's like, \"This book contains everything I know about Python. You will never need to know everything but--- and this isn't a reference guide--- but I will pour everything I know.\" Basically, the author is like \"Here's a pool of 1,600 marbles. Take the ones you want. I don't care how much time you have to waste by sorting through them to find the ones you want.\"You might think I hate the author. No, I don't. Despite all it verboseness and downsides, I still rate it 4 stars. He is, without question, a very experienced Python programmer. I think it a shame and highly unfortunate that the author possesses great knowledge about programming and Python, yet wasted most of them because of his extremely poor writing formats and too broad of audiences in mind. The code examples are golden though. It's like a maths-gifted boy trying to win a swimming medal in Olympics. The author possesses great power but wielded it the wrong way. He just doesn't know how to use and organize his extensive and vast knowledge.This book contains gold, wrapped in garbage. This is a shame. I did though, spend the time to uncover the gems. Took extra time in the process. But all things considered, no regret. And frankly, I'm a bit angry that the author wastes his knowledge about programming and Python purely due to very poor writing style.If you can disregard its verboseness and excessive pointers and read it the way I suggested above, this book is GOLDEN. The code snippets are terrific, on-point: they illustrate what the author is trying to explain in the paragraphs. They highlight various aspects of Python uses and in-depth use. Pure gold.My dream for the sixth edition:- Ask himself in mind for every paragraph: \"Do my one truly intended group of readers really need to know this?\"- Cut all the verboseness so fewer than 900 pages.- Cut all the sentences in future tense: we'll, I'll.- Cut all the pointers: #1 problemThen it would be a dream Python introduction book. \n",

      "Despite the title, this seems to me good book as long as you don't need to learn Python from it. With such a long book, I would have hoped to cover the different areas first at an elementary level, to get an initial grasp of the whole field, then go over the same areas but at a more advanced level, then more advanced, up to proficiency. But no, the author dives in in excruciating detail leaving the reader exasperated and exhausted, so that you can read hundreds, thousands of pages, and not actually be able to do anything practical at all. With all due respect to the author's undoubted expertise, It seems to be written by a windbag who is too fond of his own writing and inflicting it on the poor reader who just wants to learn the language. After struggling to about halfway, I gave up and read the book with the same title by Fabrizio Romano, which gets you up and running and doing useful things in a fraction of the time. I do come back to this book for reference, though. \n",

      " Title: Comprehensive, but probably not for new programmers \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "This book is not for the faint-hearted. It's not a quick introduction to the language, or a \"Learn Python in X Minutes\", or a light-hearted foray into what \"if\" statements and \"loops\" are. At 1600 pages long, this book is an incredibly in-depth, comprehensive dive into the fundamentals of the language. It'll teach you everything you'll ever need to know about Python, and some you might never use (there's a full two-page section on function annotations and why they're useful, for example). Learning Python documents an in-person Python course that Mark Lutz has been teaching for twenty years, and it shows: his knowledge of the language is almost unmatched.To tell you the truth, I probably wouldn't recommend the book as a person's first programming book, or, for that matter, their first Python book. The sheer density of the text will probably put a lot of first programmers off. However, for those who wish to master the basics of the language, and learn some tools easily transferable to other languages, no book compares. As other reviews have said, Lutz does tend to repeat himself quite a bit, but I think that repetition is pretty necessary to make concepts stick. I'm currently on page 568, I've been coding in Python for about 7 years, and this book seems to teach me something new every time I turn the page.Highly, highly recommend. Incredible book, incredible author. Just don't make it your first. \n",

      " Title: Needs condensing \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "The first thing that strikes you about this book is that it's big. 1500 pages big. Big enough that physically handling the book is inconvenient.Upon reading it, you'll see that much of the size comes from repetition. Many of the chapters present alternative ways to do the same thing, often using this technique as an explanatory device; yet somehow, the author manages the doublethink of continually repeating the Python \"There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it\" mantra.The order in which the material is presented is wrong. The book explains Python's basic types before its syntax; this means it's 300 pages in before you can actually start writing code that does anything. It's 473 pages in before the concept of a function is introduced; even if this text was written for those who had done no previous programming at all, this seems bizarre. Obviously the sections on types have to talk a little bit about syntax and functions (otherwise you wouldn't be able to say anything about what those types actually do in the first few chapters), which is yet again a recipe for repetition.Exercises are few and far between. There are \"quizzes\" at the end of each chapter, but they're very simple, knowledge-based questions which don't require you to write code. Programming is learned by doing, so you'll need to invent your own projects to do if you want to learn with this book.If you can ignore the structural defects, the book is beautifully written at the detailed level, and the code examples are of a high standard. It is highly readable - you won't need to continually re-read to understand what's going on - but the repetition means you will find yourself skimming or skipping large sections of the text.The book is a broad overview of a vast language; it is not a detailed API reference, and doesn't have examples of every possible API call. And neither should it be; all that stuff is online. It does explain the concepts well and give you an insight into why Python has evolved to be the way it is. However, if you're an experienced programmer looking for a quick way to break into the Python world, you might want to look for something a little more concise. \n",

As a fairly experienced dev in Java, Ruby, Go and several scripting languages what I hoped for was a (at least) semi structured walkthrough of all the key Python goodies. Instead it's more like a novel, way less blurb and more examples would have been much better.I may return to it now and then, but I'd have to be in the mood.The author would have done well to instead look at something like \"learning Perl\", which gives you everything you need in a fraction of the pages and time while doing so with style and aplomb. I think there is a balance that could/should be struck.Overall, it clear a lot of work and passion went into this, it's just not very \"consumable\" , in my view. \n",

      "After reading 1000 pages of the book I think book is very good. As a data analyst with just a little knowledge of Java and basic OOP concepts I found this book have everything beginner need to start programming in Python. When I started to learn Python I used some web tutorials, but this book gives me better understanding of things and I have really learned a lot from it.Lot of people see the size of the book as the downside, and I have to say it is depressing, but on the other hand I think see that as a benefit because book cover everything beginner need to learn to start to do some real quality programming, and I don't have to search for another sources. Anyway I don't think programming can be learned in one week after reading a 300 pages book, and shorter books don't cover this many topics.There is a lot of repetiton in the book which for me personally is not bad because I see them as a reminders and if the topic is something I feel I really understand I simply skip it.The only thing I don't like is that book's code which can be downloaded from publishers website is a complete unorganised mess, and poorly referenced in the book. So most of the time when I want I can't find the example code there, which make it completely useless.So, if you have time and want to learn Python I recommend this book, but if you have a short deadline or you don't have a lot of patients you should definitely skip it. \n",

En teoría podría servir, cubre todo desde lo básico, pero lo más probable es que no llegues a la página 200. Sencillamente tarda demasiado en arrancar (sé lo que digo, en el momento de escribir estas líneas he leído aproximadamente medio libro).También es importante mencionar que este libro no cubre ninguna librería que no sea estándar, y por tanto deja fuera cosas como Numpy, Scikit Learn, etc. Para eso hay otros libros de todas formas. Este es un libro sobre Python base estrictamente.Así que dependiendo de tu perfil este puede ser un gran libro o una pésima compra. Por eso he hecho esta pequeña review.

      " Title: Ein Biest von Buch, aber sicher eines der besten Python-Bücher, wenn man tief einsteigen will \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "Über 1.500 Seiten - das ist ein Biest von Buch. Da kann man schon mal ein paar Wochen und Monate Zeit mit verbringen. Dabei baut dieses Werk das Wissen logisch und - meiner Meinung nach auch didaktisch sehr gut gemacht - auf. Sprache und Ausdrucksweise sind sehr gut verständlich, die diversen Wiederholungen mögen dem einen oder anderen Leser überflüssig scheinen, ich empfinde das aber eher positiv, weil beim Lesen und durcharbeiten eines Buchs diesen Umfangs am Ende doch mehr Wissen dauerhaft hängen bleibt. Wer Python ernsthafter und intensiver nutzen möchte, ist gut beraten, sich dieses Buch anzuschaffen, denn es hat Referenzcharakter. Man findet sehr viele Themen und der Index ist gut gepflegt.Ich habe schon diverse Projekte in Java, C++ und C# realisiert, auch recht umfangreiche mit und ohne GUI, multithreaded, parallel und auch nicht parallel. Und dennoch muss ich sagen, dass - mal angesehen von den grundlegenden Sprachkonstrukten (Bedingungen, Operatoren, Schleifen, Listen, Arrays, Dictionaries etc ppa.), die in allen Programmiersprachen hinreichend ähnlich bis nahezu identisch aufgebaut und nutzbar sind - dieses Buch sehr deutlich zeigt, dass Python bei weitem alles andere als nur eine einfache \"Script\"-Sprache ist. Man kann definitiv schnell und easy Scripts mit Python schreiben und das auf vielen Betriebssystemen. Das ist genial. Alle erforderlichen Grundlagen dafür werden vom Author solide vermittelt und alle Konzepte sind hinreichend mit Beispiel-Code belegt. Easy to follow!Aber mit Python lassen sich auch mächtige und trotzdem effiziente Programme schreiben. Ich betreibe z.B. einen Cluster mit 15 Raspi 3B+ Platinen (60 Threads), um neuronale Netze, parallele Algorithmen für Machine Learning und Programme (in MPI programmiert) zu erforschen, eigene Programme zu schreiben etc. ppa. Neben C++ ist hier Python eine hervorragend geeignete Sprache nicht nur für die Steuerung und das Monitoring meines Raspi-Clusters, sondern eben auch für die darauf laufenden verteilten Anwendungen inkl. GUIs z.B. mit Tkinter oder Anbindung an MySQL oder SQL-Server für Datenbanken. Bei all diesen Python-Projekten hat mir das Buch von Mark Lutz erheblich weitergeholfen. Dazu habe ich auch sein zweites \"Big Beast\" mit dem Titel \"Programming Python\", das ebenfalls gute 1.500 Seiten hat, gelesen, wo es um die praktischen Anwendungen, also der echten Programmierung von GUIs und zahlreichen realen Anwendungen aus verschiedenen Bereichen geht. Auch dieses zweite Buch ist ein Referenzwerk für mich.Insgesamt kann ich \"Learning Python\" von Mark Lutz jedem empfehlen, der ein tieferes Verständnis von Python entwickeln möchte und der eben nicht nur ein paar kleine Scripts basteln möchte. Dafür gibt es sehr viel kürzere und kompaktere Darstellungen. Aber wer Python - wie ich - auch für größere und ernsthafte Projekte einsetzen möchte, sollte dieses Buch lesen und es in Greifnähe behalten. Ich beschäftige mich seit gut 1,5 Jahren intensiv mit Python und schlage noch immer das eine oder andere Thema in diesem Buch nach.Als absolut hilfreiche und lesenswerte Ergänzung zu den beiden Büchern von Mark Lutz möchte ich hier auch das Buch \"The Python 3 Standard Library by Example\" von Doug Hellmann empfehlen. Es gibt für mich kein besseres Buch, dass die unglaublich umfangreichen Standardbibliotheken von Python so gut erklärt. Für Fortgeschrittene, die mal Profi werden wollen, eine wahre Goldgrube. \n",

Auch kann ich sagen, das Buch zielt auf Python 3.3 ab...liefert jedoch massiv Material online (vom Autor) das bis Python 3.6 geht.Ich selbst hatte die erste Bestellung zurück geschickt, da das Buch beschädigt gewesen ist...und ? Mängelrüge, neues Buch und fertig (das schreib ich wegen der 1 (!) negativen 1 Sterne Bewertung) .Zielgruppe:Für blutige Anfänger ist das Werk hier nichts. Man sollte minimum eine Ausbildung zum FIAE haben, besser noch direkt Techniker oder akademisches Studium. Ein Newbie wird es schwer haben direkt am Anfang mit Collections, Datentypen, Objekten usw. konfrontiert zu werden. Der Autor geht davon aus, das man dieses Basiswissen verfügt. Generell liest sich das Werk hier so, als wenn man vom Studium direkt abgeholt wird, auch dieses bestätigt der Autor. Gefällt mir, ich kann mir vieles wieder auffrischen und lerne zugleich Python auf ein angenehmes Niveau. \n",

      " Title: Not suitable for beginners \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "This book is huge and goes into vast detail. There is considerable repetition, and it is jargon heavy. If you are an experienced programmer who came up via the computer science route, it will all make sense and you will be able to relate it to things you already know about. If not, you could find yourself drowning in a sea of words.I'm leaving this review because I think the title is a bit misleading. The blurb describes it as an \"easy to follow self-paced tutorial\". I would not use this book as a general textbook to learn Python in this way. It is quite abstract. For instance, when the author starts on OOP, he seems to focus on how Python implements OO internally. The way that the interpreter searches for class members up a tree is part of the technical detail of the language itself, but it isn't much use to a programmer who just wants to convert some OO code from another language into Python, or someone who doesn't yet understand OO. At one point the author seems to be reassuring his audience that this OO stuff isn't really a new paradigm, it's just a slightly different way of doing the same thing that is already done by modules and packages.I think the main use for this book is for someone who finds himself in a new job where there is a lot of pre-existing Python code to be maintained and added to, and where over the years a number of different approaches have been used so that he is constantly coming across new usage patterns, or the same thing done in different ways. For this, it is very good because of its exhaustive attention to detail. For someone who just wants to learn the basics of a programming language, this book could be extremely off-putting. For instance, although the author claims that the Python syntax makes it easier to understand than Java, there are plenty of excellent Java textbooks which explain OO and its Java implementation very clearly. Putting them side by side might well convince the beginner that Java is much easier to learn.It certainly has a place and it is valuable that so much information is available in one place. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "Ritengo che i linguaggi di programmazione abbiano molti punti in comune con i linguaggi umani; direte: è ovvio. ma a parte gli accostamenti più scontati, spesso quello che non viene subito alla mente è che anche la modalità di apprendimento è simile. Considerate questo libro quindi come un manuale di lingua, come quelli che si usano al liceo: vi insegnerà grammatica e sintassi del linguaggio, condendola con cenni storici, in un inglese semplice, piacevole ed efficace.Il dubbio di fondo resta se questo sia il modo migliore per imparare un linguaggio di programmazione. a mio avviso no: come insegnano i deludenti risultati dello studio delle linguee straniere nelle scuole di vario ordine e grado, spesso a studiare con i manuali si imparano più le eccezioni e le peculiarità che la capacità di esprimersi in una lingua. Pertanto, per chi volesse imparare realmente il python, consegno un Workcamp, o un corso intensivo, o un mentore.Delineato quanto sopra (l'ho ritenuto moralmente doveroso verso i novizi della programmazione) resta una delle, se non LA, migliore grammatica e raccolta sintattica del Python. Buon studio e buon lavoro. \n",

      " Title: Python – DAS Kompendium \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "Das vorliegende Buch ist ein umfassendes Kompendium der Programmiersprache Python, in aller Ausführlichkeit werden seine Syntax, fundamentalen Konstrukte,  Design Ideen und  Struktur Paradigmen im Zusammenhang und in aller gebotenen Tiefe erörtert – 'Learning Phython' konzentriert sich dabei bewusst auf die core language.Python ist eine extrem einfache Sprache, die schon optisch durch ihre Klammer-lose Block- Strukturen aus der Menge hervor sticht, Variablen müssen nicht umständlich typisiert werden und haben in der Regel schon den richtigen Scope, andererseits lassen sich aus Arrays und assoziativen Arrays (Dictionaries) ad hoc komplexe Strukturen bilden, schließlich kennt Python mächtige objektorientierte Konstruktion, die mit minimalen syntaktischen Aufwand verwende werden können. Sämtliche dieser Design Entscheidungen sind auf Einfachheit und  Effektivität ausgerichtet, sicher auch ein Grund, weswegen Python in den letzten Jahren vielfältige Anwendungen in den Bereichen Künstliche Intelligenz und Maschinellen Lernen fand.Das Buch ist systematisch als Tutorial aufgebaut, natürlicherweise beginnt die Darstellung bei den elementare Builtin Typen, konditionalen Verzweigungen, Loops und Iteratoren, gefolgt von Listen, Tuples, Dictionaries und Files. Klassen sind das Grundkonstrukt, wenn es um die Bündelung von beliebigen Attributen, d.h. sowohl Feldern als auch Funktionen, resp. Methoden, geht; das Klassenmodel von Python ist sehr flexible und erlaubt Mehrfachvererbung und die Überladung von Operatoren. Ein wesentlicher 'Trick' von Python ist aber die Offenlegung von 'magischen' (managed) Attributen, mit ihrer Hilfe können so ziemlich alle Aspekte von Funktionen und Aspekte a posteriori beeinflusst werden.  Sie sind das Geheimnis hinter solchen fortgeschritteneren Konstrukten wie Decorators und Properties, selbstverständlich ist auch die Instanziierung von Klassen kontrollierbar – mittels sogenannter Metaklassen. Es gehört sicher zu besonderen Reiz von Python, dass diese elaborierten Paradigmen dank der Offenheit dieser 'magic elements' leicht verständlich und nachvollziehbar bleiben.Bei all den Details, die das Buch von Python offenbart, ist es kein Referenz Manual und will das auch nicht sein, wie der Autor im Vorwort bekennt, eben sowenig ist es ein Guide zum 'Bauen' von Anwendungen aus  'bewerten' Code Schnipseln. Sicher wird der Leser, den größten Gewinn aus dem vorliegenden Buch ziehen, der eine saubere Diskussion von Grundlagen erwarten, der aber vor allem die Dinge in ihrem Zusammenspiel verstehen möchte.  Dieses Kompendium ist dank seines soliden Stiles auch für erfahrene Programmierer eine unschätzbare Fundgrube und Lesegenus. Es gehört zweifellos zu jenen Standardwerken, die ganze Regal- Meter von 'easy intro...' oder '… in xx days' überflüssig werden lassen – und es gehört damit ebenbürtig in die Reihe von Werken wie Kernighan 'The C Programming Language' oder Stevens 'TCP/IP'.Das Werk ist auch ein Beweis für die Stabilität der O' Reily Paperback Buchbindung, die die fast 1600 Seiten sicher hält; das “Hand“-buch, mit seinen  stattlichen 3kg, sollte aber längere Zeit nur mit einer festen Unterlage benutzt werden. \n",

      " Title: very good didactically structured, for those who want to delve into the deep universe of python \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "As a student of biotechnology (and like everyone else in life sciences and engineering), I have to face the truth that there is hardly any approach to science, which does not require at least some computational work. As for my scientific field, informatics become increasingly important for the huge amount of data generated by experiments. Human brains are trained tracing patterns and fitting them to model but are less suitable for mining large sets of data. Good we came up with computers to do this job for us and in order to get this done we have to tell them what to do.For trained biologist like me i don't have to know every bit of detail how a compiler of any language maps it's byte code to the physical resources of the machine and with Python you don't have to.Setting up is straightforward and with it's explicit syntax the language forces you to write structured easy to read code. This in turn aids to it serving as a tool for telling machines what we want them to do.Mark Lutz's book is a well written narrative on an easy to learn programming language with vast capability of developing tools for scientific and other uses. His writing style is very appealing and it is only at few times that the text feels boring. With his bottom up approach of teaching the language you will soon be able to write your own functions, classes and programs with Python. Furthermore it intrinsically delivers a feeling for the language and it's tools. Ultimately one of the best books I did ever read.If you are a beginner in programming and want to get a grip on Python as a tool. This is definitely the book for you. \n",

J’ai plus l’impression qu’il étale ses connaissances qu’il ne s’intéresse réellement à son audience. Le livre pourrait facilement être divisé par 3 ou 4 avec un contenu plus pertinent pour python 3 (un lecteur qui s’intéresse à python 2 achèterait une ancienne édition).Et en bonus, on a un grand nombre d’éloges sur la supériorité du langage python sur d’autres langages. Quand ca va au dela de la preface (le marketing), c’est un peu fatiguant. Et clairement l’auteur ne maîtrise pas autant les autres langages auxquels il compare python.

      "The book is huge and gives a reader a deep understanding of Python both in 2.X and 3.X versions.Everything is explained from all possible angles and with many (really, many) examples.Why 3/5 then?Well, often during reading this book I had a feeling, that the author was being paid by the number of pages. Often he described even the simplest ideas on two pages and repeated himself over and over again. Frankly, sometimes I thought that that he thinks a reader is an idiot.Also the huge number of examples isn't such a great thing considering that after 5 or 10 trivial examples and getting what the idea is, you would expect a few more advanced to keep your brain working. But no, after that you get another 5 or 10 trivial examples which are just too similar to the previous ones. As a result most of this book is horribly boring (and that's really a lot of pages).So to summarize - the book itself contains a great dose of knowledge but the same could've been fit to the half of the volume without losing any bit of information and understandability. \n",

      " Review: \n",
      "I decided to take the plunge and learn python and chose this book to do so(mostly based on review and the page counts)  This is a very good book to learn python as it covers ALOT.  It's well written, takes it's time explaining things(a bit too much even if you are familiar with basic programmation) and it will accomplish it's goal, whis is to teach us the python language.It's only shortcomings are1-  It's awfully repetitive in some places and most of chapter 4I should be scrapped and carbage-collected.  The reason is that it introduce the objects type we find in python, but kept telling you \"we won't go here in depth, as we will cover it later on\"  Later on being chapter 5-7-8-9.  So, it's not like it is introducing something we need to comprehend the following chapters, as the following chapters are an in-depth look at the various objects types we find in python.  As such,  what's the point of chapter 4?  Just get rid of it and start with chapter 5.2- The author is teaching us about python in a somewhat dry approach.  Meaning we are learning the language, piece by piece, instead of learning through coding(If you ever read any \"Head First\" book, you know what I mean by learning through coding)  I'd have prefered a more practical approach in the first chapters, as it's pretty boring to simply read about objects type for 300 pages.  At least, as I noted above, the author writing is good, so it's not as boring as it could be :PSo, good introduction to python.  Not sure if I'll buy the follow up book \"Programming python\" though.  I might go with the Cookbook instead. \n",

      "It's vastly overlong, and incomplete.  Of the 1500+ pages, I thought \"well, at least it'll be comprehensive\".So I search for shell, shell escapes, executing, popen, running, os. , and so on in the index.A few scraps.  Popen is how you'd call the shell to run commands, by the way.  Lots of options and subtleties.  Important and useful for a scripting language like Python, where you'll often be interacting with the o/s.There turned out to be next to nothing on what I would have devoted a chapter to.  Oh, and everywhere there are references to \"we'll cover that in chapter x\".  If you could be bothered to go that far.  I have several of the authors books; this is by far the worst, and is one of the poorer technical books I've encountered.  A shame, as it seems to me such a missed opportunity.Another example: parsing command-line arguments, which is supposed to be achieved with argumentparser.  In 1500 pages, there's nothing on that; Oh, I lied.  There's 1 reference, which simply refers to getopt, argparse, and optparse.  No recommendations, no details, and a suggestion that you use the built-in function input() to prompt the user (FGS has the author ever written a command-line program?).I find docs.python.org pretty unusable, (maybe that's my fault), but this is actually worse!1500 pages should mean it's a reference book.  This is not.BTW, just how is this an unhelpful review?  If you love the book, fine, but don't be childish and vote down people who disagree.  Sigh. \n",

There's nothing decent about this book. It's next to impossible to find anything really useful because he just dips his toe into the water on various topics and never gets to really \"swimming\". But you drown in his text, smothered by heaps of bloat and crap.I bought this with several other much shorter books and when I found something interesting in those little books - I'd look to this huge book to see some further explanation only to find that the thing that interests me isn't even mentioned in Lutz's book! For instance, there's a great method for manipulating strings called \"partition\" which is nowhere to be found. Anything that I was interested in simply couldn't be found in this book and if I did happen to find anything of interest to me, it was covered so briefly that even Python Visual Quickstart Guide (only 200 pages) did a far, far better job.This book is sooooo bad.

A edición gustoume muito, e moi fácil de seguir e recomendoó a aqueles que coma eu, sepamos os conceptos de programción. Outro consello que vos dou, é que ó rematarmos este libro, merquemos o de Python Programming, que nos axuda a aplicar os contidos aprendidos neste libro a situacións reais. Para os que non estean iniciados na programación, o mellor é o de Thinking Python, a min axudoume moitísimo. Para fusos máis avanzados están o de Python for Data Analisys, e o de Python for Finances, son uns libros excelentes, e en liñas xerais, esta editorial é formidabel. \n",

      "Ce livre est à avoir avec soit, à lire chapitre par chapitre et à consulter avant de commencer un projet python.Il y a dedans beaucoup d'indication sur des choix à faire. Exemple : faut il utiliser import à la place de from ou inversement ?je le recommande vivement à ceux qui veule avoir un niveau professionnel en développement python. \n",

      " Title: Become less informative than the previous editions \n",
      " Review: \n",
      "I have being keeping the second edition of this book. It helps me lots  It was for python 2.x but I  started with 3.x.  So I bought the latest edition (kindle version).  The new edition discarded one of the usefule chapters; the compact summary of some basic modules. The author keeps insisting that the book is not the reference book.  But think how the beginner uses the book; for instance, in my case, I hate to cosult with many books and reference  books when I write \"working codes\".  Python is the language for the pragmatist who learns Python to write the codes to be used for himself immediately.  Unfortunately with this new edition, I cannot code the usable codes without the old edition at my side.  In addition, at leasst the first few chapters contain too much of excuse. You'd better change the title of the book. \n",
